% Radiation components

% Import SW traces twice, first for testing, second for final overwriting with final values

% Edited by Rosie (20 March 2025)
%	- Added clamped_minMax for PPFD_IN_1_1_1 and PPFD_OUT_1_1_1 with lower bound of zero, to be consistent with SW.
% Edited by Rosie Howard (9 December 2024)
%	- Removed duplicate SW_IN_1_1_1 and SW_OUT_1_1_1 traces. 
% 	- Switched the order of SW_IN and SW_OUT because Evaluate 
%	  statement uses SW_OUT in SW_IN filter, so SW_OUT needs to be defined first.
